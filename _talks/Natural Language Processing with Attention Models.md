 From this certification I have gained knowledge in following areas,
 
a) Translate complete English sentences into Portuguese using an encoder-decoder attention model,
b) Build a Transformer model to summarize text, 
c) Use T5 and BERT models to perform question-answering.

In this cousrse I have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, and created tools to translate languages and summarize text!
