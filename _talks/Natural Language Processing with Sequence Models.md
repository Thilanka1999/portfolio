 From this certification I have gained knowledge in following areas,
 
a) Train a neural network with word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

 In this course I have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text!
