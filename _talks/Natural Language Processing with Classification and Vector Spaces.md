 From this certification I have gained knowledge in following areas,
 
a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.  

In there I have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text.
